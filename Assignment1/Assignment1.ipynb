    "A perspective view of [Euclid's orchard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_orchard) is essentially the same thing except that, rather than plotting points, one plots vertical lines from $y=f(x)$ to $y=0$. (The lines correspond to trees whose variation in height is due to distance from the observer.) You can enhance the look of the orchard by plotting points (the Thomae function) as well as lines. By varying the marker size (point size) you have give the orchard some added sense of depth.\n",

The functions should return an np.array with the series approximation evaluated at the values in array `x`.

You can decide what you think looks nice. You will want to play with line weights and line styles to distinguish the true and approximate curves. You will also need to adjust the plot limits.

These roller coasters do not have to make mechanical sense. For example, they can have sharp corners. However, they must be closed so that the passengers can get off where they got on. They cannot self-intersect for passenger safety. \n",

There can be at most one straight section. One section must be a \"fun feature\", meaning that it looks fun, so at a minimum this section does not lie in a plane. \n",

    "- Python will be very helpful in designing your roller coaster. \n",
    "    - We suggest starting with the parameterisation of a helix, even if you do not want to use the helix in your roller coaster. Figure out how you want to plot it. Use subplots to show more than one view. Consider [this sketch of a chair](http://chairnotes.blogspot.com/2007/10/drawing.html) and Google \"orthographic views\".\n",
    "    - Once you are able to plot and view the helix, start generating and plotting different parameterised curves for sections of the roller coaster. This is easy in Python once you have one section. Work at getting sections to line up end to end, so that you have a closed roller coaster. \n",
