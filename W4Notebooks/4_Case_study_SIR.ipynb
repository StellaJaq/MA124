    "where $S$ is the number of susceptible individuals, $I$ is the number of infective individuals, $R$ is the number of recovered or removed individuals. $N$ is the total number of individuals, i.e. $N = S+I+R$. One can easily verify that $\\dot N = 0$ by adding three equation. Hence $N$ is constant. $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are parameters: $\\beta$ is the average number of contacts per person per time, $\\gamma$ is the reciprocal of the time an individual remains infective. \n",
